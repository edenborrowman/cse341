    Everything is working correctly...now. It took a LOOONG time to figure out a bug and fix it. Turns out, I'd deleted everything in my cart.json file, just leaving an empty object (thinking it would just reset everything). What I should have done was delete the data, but leave the structure, so it would look like this: {"products": [], "totalPrice":0}
